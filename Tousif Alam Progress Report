#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have to meet up with my group members to figure out how should we split the work up evenly. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

In our code, it reads and stores the user input properly but it doesn't display the current entries before closing when user inputs "no" after their entries. 
Also, in the code a function is automatically runs without being called.
