Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Created ‘main’ script which creates SQL database file & table with connection. Also built function which takes user input as entries to ‘ingredients’ table. Created ‘SQLite tutorial’ pdf & ‘to-do’/next steps pdf.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We have not determined the formatting of nor created a table to store recipes. We also lack a function which can delete entries from the ingredients table.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Script currently cannot run without making some kind of manipulation to the table. I would like to create a more ‘stable’ startup which waits for user input before adding or deleting to any table.
